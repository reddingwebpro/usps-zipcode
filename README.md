# usps-zipcode
This CLASS is designed to take advantage of the USPS API for looking up the zip code for a given physical address. There is very little examples of implementing the USPS API in PHP. 
  
#Configuration
When you instantiate the class, include the API key. See the example.php file for usage. If you don't have a valid USPS.com API, you can get one free at https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/welcome.htm 

#Revision History:
* 1.0 Initial Release
* 1.1 Moved into its own namespace, api key defined when class is instantiated, moved the sample code into it's own file.

#Misc
This is also a test for me as this is the first time I've developed code in the public using git. Most code has been for private repositories. This testing will be integrated with phpStorm.
