USPS ZIP CODE Lookup using PHP/CURL

This CLASS is designed to take advantage of the USPS API for looking up the zip code for a given physical address. There is very little examples of implementing the USPS API in PHP. 

This is also a test for me as this is the first time I've developed code in the public using git. Most code has been for private repositories. This testing will be integrated with phpStorm.
